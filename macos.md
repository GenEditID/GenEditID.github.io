### Specific help for macOS

Due to the improved gatekeeper on macOS Catalina the system settings might have to be changed to allow program installation. If installation is blocked follow these steps:
- In terminal type the following command syntax
```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
- Authenticate with your admin password.
- Go into your System preferences and choose 'Security & Privacy'. Tap the lock at the bottom left of the screen.
- Enter your password to unlock Security and Privacy.
- Choose 'Anywhere' under 'Allow apps downloaded from'.
- Click again on the lock to keep the changes.
